                           The upgrade includes several database and file structure changes. Depending on the amount of data you have in your system (such as projects, groups, etc.), it may take a while to perform.<br/><br/>

                           If you rely on third-party extensions, please check the corresponding author/vendor for available updates before continuing. You can install/update those extensions after this procedure.</p><hr /><br/>
